##### Why use PyStream?

PyStream allows you to download multiple youtube videos using their url. It does this by reading them from a text file. 
PyStream is the ideal choice for automating the download of videos/audio from youtube since it does not require the user to input new links after each download is complete unlike the online youtube to mp3 converters.
PyStream also comes with a built-in mp4 to mp3 converter tool. Even though PyStream was originally built for downloading music, the use of the converter tool is completely optional. Making it useful as just a video downloader.
